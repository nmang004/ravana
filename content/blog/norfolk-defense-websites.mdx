Norfolk is home to the world's largest naval base and hundreds of defense contractors supporting military operations worldwide. Your website isn't just marketing—it's often the first impression contracting officers and prime contractors have of your capabilities.

A defense contractor website must accomplish three critical objectives: communicate competence, demonstrate security commitment, and comply with increasingly stringent regulations.

This guide shows Norfolk defense contractors how to build websites that win contracts while meeting DoD security requirements.

## Why Defense Contractor Websites Are Different

Defense contracting demands higher standards than most industries. Your website must reflect that reality.

### Security Is Non-Negotiable

Defense contractors handle sensitive information—classified materials, CUI (Controlled Unclassified Information), ITAR data, and proprietary government information.

Your website architecture must demonstrate security-first thinking. SSL certificates and basic passwords aren't enough—you need enterprise-grade security infrastructure.

Contracting officers and security compliance teams review your website. Obvious security gaps signal broader capability concerns.

### Compliance Requirements

**CMMC (Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification)**: DoD's framework for cybersecurity requirements. While CMMC primarily governs internal systems, your public website still reflects your security posture.

**NIST 800-171**: Standards for protecting CUI. Your website should align with these principles even if it doesn't host CUI directly.

**ITAR Compliance**: Contractors handling defense articles must ensure websites don't inadvertently disclose controlled technical data.

### Professional Credibility

Government contracts often worth millions depend partially on perceived competence. An outdated or unprofessional website suggests outdated capabilities.

Your website communicates whether you're a tier-one contractor worthy of major programs or a small player not ready for prime time.

## Essential Features for Defense Contractor Websites

Norfolk defense contractor sites need specific elements that commercial websites don't require.

### Capabilities Showcase

**What to Include**: Clearly articulated core competencies, technical expertise areas, certifications and clearances, past performance (where disclosable), key contracts and customers (when allowed).

**Balance**: Share enough to demonstrate capability without disclosing classified or proprietary information. This balance requires careful content planning.

**Specificity**: Vague language like "systems integration" doesn't differentiate you. Specific capabilities like "F-35 avionics integration" or "shipboard C4ISR systems" communicate expertise.

### Security Credentials

**Certifications**: Display prominently—ISO 9001, AS9100, CMMC level, facility clearance level, NIST 800-171 compliance.

**Clearance Information**: Personnel clearance levels your team holds (without identifying specific cleared individuals publicly).

**Facility Security**: FCL (Facility Clearance Level) and approved safeguarding capabilities.

These credentials signal to contracting officers that you're ready for sensitive work.

### Case Studies & Past Performance

**Challenge**: Most defense work is classified or proprietary. How do you showcase capabilities without disclosing protected information?

**Solution**: Sanitized case studies that describe problem, approach, and results without revealing classified details.

Example: Instead of "We integrated [classified system] into [program name]," write "We successfully integrated complex avionics subsystems into tactical aircraft platforms, delivering on schedule and under budget while maintaining full security compliance."

**Prime Contractor Relationships**: When allowed, mention that you support Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems, or other major primes without disclosing program details.

### Team & Expertise

**Leadership Bios**: Military background, security clearances, relevant experience, industry recognition.

**Technical Staff**: Overall team capability without compromising OPSEC—"15 engineers with TS/SCI clearances" not "John Smith holds TS/SCI."

**Facility Information**: Where you're located, square footage, specialized equipment, security infrastructure (SCIF availability, etc.).

### Compliance & Quality

**Quality Management**: ISO 9001, AS9100, or other quality certifications.

**Environmental Compliance**: ISO 14001 if applicable.

**Safety Programs**: OSHA compliance, safety record.

**Cybersecurity**: CMMC level, NIST 800-171 compliance, security program overview.

These details matter tremendously when primes evaluate potential subcontractors.

### Contact & Engagement

**BD Team**: Business development contact information separated from general inquiries.

**Secure Communication**: Encrypted contact forms, secure file upload capabilities for RFP responses.

**Registration Systems**: CAGE code, DUNS number, SAM.gov registration status.

Make it easy for contracting officers to engage with correct personnel.

## Security Infrastructure Requirements

Defense contractor websites need security architecture that reflects your commitment to protecting sensitive information.

### Hosting Considerations

**U.S.-Based Hosting**: Government contractors should use U.S.-based hosting providers. Some contracts explicitly require U.S. hosting.

**FedRAMP Authorized**: For contractors handling CUI or working on programs requiring FedRAMP compliance, choose FedRAMP-authorized hosting (AWS GovCloud, Azure Government, etc.).

**DDoS Protection**: Enterprise-grade DDoS mitigation to prevent site availability attacks.

**Redundancy**: Multiple backups, failover systems, and disaster recovery plans.

### SSL/TLS Implementation

**Certificate Authority**: Use recognized certificate authorities (DigiCert, GlobalSign, etc.), not free options that might raise questions.

**Strong Encryption**: TLS 1.2 minimum, preferably TLS 1.3. Disable outdated protocols (SSL 2.0/3.0, TLS 1.0/1.1).

**HSTS Headers**: HTTP Strict Transport Security ensures browsers always connect via HTTPS.

### Form Security

**Encryption**: All form submissions must use end-to-end encryption.

**CAPTCHA**: Prevent automated submissions and bot attacks.

**Input Validation**: Sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks.

**Secure Storage**: If collecting sensitive information, encrypt database storage.

### Access Controls

**Admin Security**: Strong password requirements, two-factor authentication, role-based access control.

**Login Monitoring**: Track failed login attempts, geographic anomalies, and suspicious activity.

**Regular Audits**: Quarterly security reviews and penetration testing.

### Compliance Documentation

**Privacy Policy**: GDPR compliance if you work with European defense partners, plus general privacy standards.

**Security Policy**: Public-facing overview of your security commitment.

**Incident Response**: Clear process for reporting security concerns.

## Content Strategy for Defense Contractors

What you say and how you say it communicates professionalism and competence.

### Technical Precision

Government audiences expect precision. Vague marketing speak undermines credibility.

**Bad**: "We provide innovative solutions for warfighter needs."

**Good**: "We design and manufacture ruggedized communications systems for tactical ground vehicles, with 15+ years supporting Marine Corps programs."

Specificity builds confidence. Vague generalities suggest you don't actually know the domain.

### Capability Statements

Every defense contractor needs clear capability statements for primary competency areas.

Structure: Problem → Your Capability → Typical Applications → Differentiators

Example: "Norfolk naval contractors face challenges integrating modernization programs into legacy shipboard systems. Our team specializes in cybersecure integration of networked systems aboard DDG-51 class destroyers. Our differentiator: 100% on-time delivery record across 12 ship installations."

### Thought Leadership

Position your team as industry experts through content that demonstrates deep knowledge.

**White Papers**: Technical discussions of industry challenges, new technologies, or regulatory changes.

**Blog Posts**: Analysis of defense budget trends, contract vehicle updates, technology assessments.

**Presentations**: Conference presentations or webinar content (sanitized for public consumption).

This content serves dual purpose: SEO value and credibility building with decision-makers who research before engaging.

### ITAR Awareness

Defense contractors must carefully review all website content for ITAR compliance.

**Restricted Content**: Technical data about defense articles, detailed specifications, proprietary manufacturing processes.

**Safe Content**: General capability descriptions, sanitized past performance, team credentials, company information.

When in doubt, have ITAR compliance review content before publishing. One mistake could trigger State Department investigation.

## SEO for Defense Contractors

Norfolk defense contractors compete for government searches and prime contractor discovery.

### Target Keywords

**Service + Clearance**: "TS/SCI software development," "secret clearance engineers Norfolk"

**Capability + Location**: "shipboard integration Norfolk," "naval systems Virginia"

**Program Support**: "DDG-51 contractors," "F-35 subcontractors" (where appropriate)

**Contract Vehicles**: "OASIS small business," "SeaPort-e contractors"

Many government contracting officers research potential vendors via Google. Ranking for relevant terms gets you on their radar.

### Content Marketing

Regular blog posts about industry topics help you rank for long-tail keywords while demonstrating expertise.

**Topics**: Defense budget analysis, contract vehicle updates, compliance requirement changes, technology trends in defense, Norfolk naval industry news.

This content attracts both search engines and human decision-makers.

### Local SEO

Optimize for "defense contractors Norfolk" and related local searches. Many prime contractors prefer local subcontractors for proximity to programs.

Complete Google Business Profile, local citations, and Norfolk-specific content help with local visibility.

## Common Mistakes Defense Contractors Make

Avoid these errors that undermine your website's effectiveness.

### Disclosing Sensitive Information

Accidentally publishing classified information, CUI, or ITAR-controlled technical data creates massive compliance problems.

Implement content review processes: technical staff write, compliance reviews, then publish.

### Generic Messaging

Websites that could describe any contractor don't differentiate you. "Quality service since 1995" means nothing.

Specific capabilities, quantifiable results, and concrete differentiators win contracts.

### Poor Mobile Experience

Government personnel research contractors on phones and tablets between meetings. Mobile-unfriendly sites frustrate them.

Ensure full mobile optimization—readable text, touch-friendly navigation, fast load times.

### Outdated Information

Nothing says "we don't care about details" like a website showing 2019 news as "recent updates" in 2025.

Regular content updates demonstrate active, engaged operations.

### Security Theater

Displaying security badges you haven't actually earned or claiming compliance you haven't achieved backfires dramatically when discovered.

Only claim certifications and compliance you've legitimately obtained. False claims can disqualify you from contracts.

### Ignoring Contract Opportunities

Your website should help capture leads from RFP research, but many contractors treat sites as static brochures.

Include clear contact paths for business development, secure document upload for teaming opportunities, and calls-to-action for contracting officers.

## RFP Response Support

Your website can streamline RFP response processes.

### Resource Repository

**Capability Statements**: Downloadable PDFs of detailed capabilities for each core competency.

**Company Information**: Pre-formatted company overview, facility information, past performance summaries.

**Certifications**: Current certifications, compliance documentation, insurance certificates.

When responding to RFPs, having organized digital assets saves time and ensures consistency.

### Secure Portal

For established clients and teaming partners, consider secure portals for:

**Document Sharing**: Exchange RFP documents, proposals, and sensitive planning materials.

**Collaboration Spaces**: Work on proposals with teammates securely.

**Past Performance**: Detailed performance data you can't publish publicly.

## Investment Considerations

Defense contractor websites require higher investment than standard business sites due to security requirements and technical complexity.

### Typical Costs

**Entry Level**: $15,000-$25,000 for basic contractor site with proper security infrastructure, capability showcase, and professional design.

**Mid-Range**: $25,000-$50,000 for comprehensive site with secure portals, extensive content, advanced SEO, and compliance features.

**Enterprise**: $50,000-$150,000+ for complex sites with custom applications, multiple portals, integrations, and ongoing compliance management.

### ROI Perspective

If your website helps win one additional $500,000 contract, even a $40,000 site investment provides 1,150% ROI.

Defense contractors bidding multi-million dollar programs can't afford unprofessional websites that cost them credibility.

## Choosing the Right Developer

Not every web developer understands defense contractor needs.

### Required Expertise

**Security Knowledge**: Developer must understand enterprise security, encryption, and compliance requirements.

**Defense Industry Experience**: Familiarity with CMMC, NIST 800-171, ITAR, and government contracting.

**Professional Design**: Capability to create authoritative, credible design appropriate for government audiences.

**Compliance Awareness**: Understanding of what can and can't be published about defense work.

### Questions to Ask

"Have you built websites for defense contractors before?"

"How do you ensure security best practices in development?"

"Are you familiar with CMMC, NIST 800-171, and ITAR compliance considerations?"

"Can you provide references from defense industry clients?"

Developers without defense industry experience often miss critical requirements.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do we need CMMC certification for our public website?**

Your public website doesn't process CUI so full CMMC certification isn't required for the site itself. However, the site should reflect security best practices that align with CMMC principles. Contracting officers do review your site as part of overall capability assessment.

**Can we mention classified programs on our website?**

Never disclose classified program details, code names, or protected information. Use sanitized language that describes capabilities without revealing classified specifics. When in doubt, consult your FSO.

**Should our website be hosted on .gov or .mil domains?**

No—those are government domains. Defense contractors use .com domains with proper security infrastructure. Claiming government association you don't have creates serious problems.

**How do we showcase past performance without violating NDAs?**

Use general descriptions: "Supported tactical communications programs for Marine Corps" instead of specific program names. Focus on capabilities demonstrated rather than contract details.

**Is our current commercial website sufficient?**

Depends on your contracts and capabilities. If you're pursuing sophisticated programs requiring high clearances, your website should reflect that professionalism. Simple commercial sites work for basic commercial contracting but undermine credibility for complex defense programs.

**What security certifications should we display?**

Only certifications you've legitimately earned: facility clearance level, CMMC level (once certified), ISO 9001, AS9100, NIST 800-171 compliance. False claims are discovered during due diligence.

**Do we need separate public and private portals?**

Many contractors benefit from public website for general marketing plus secure portal for teaming partners and clients to share RFP materials and sensitive planning documents.
